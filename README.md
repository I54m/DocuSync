# DocuSync
Git Repository for DocuSync Windows Desktop Application

A general idea of an app that creates local symlinks for files/folders to copies that are stored on a slower smb share. This idea came after skyrim saves to my network shared documents folders took almost a minute while locally the saves only took a split second. This app was meant to bring the speed of local storage and the benefits I had come to love from NAS smb documents folders
